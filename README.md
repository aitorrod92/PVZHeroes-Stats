# PVZHeroes-Stats
"Plants vs Zombies: Heroes(TM)" is a phone strategy game created in 2016 by Electronic Arts. At December 2020, it included 579 different cards, each containing different values for 13 fields. This means that the whole desk has around 7500 values, most of which have some kind of influence in the game output.

"PVZHeroes-Stats" is an application to help players to visualize and understand that huge amount of data by two ways: launching queries and creating charts. Among its main functionalities, there are:

- Cards searching applying different filters, either using the GUI or SQL.
